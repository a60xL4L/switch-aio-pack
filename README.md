# switch-aio-pack
AIO HackPack for switch, will include many basic things to prevent issues and help users!
Will be broken up by branches or folders for stages of homebrew, such as a base pack (for fresh consoles from stock to modded) then a addons pack (from barebones/base homebrew to able to install games and theme, etc).
The basic pack will probably contain a few NROs of choice for utility reasons, and a atmosphere MTIM host blocker (90dns basically but embedded in and doesn't use dns servers)
